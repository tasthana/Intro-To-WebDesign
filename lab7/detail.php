                <h2>Ball Boys and Girls</h2>
                <p>Aside from the referee and the players, the only people on the court are the Ball Boys and Girls.
                 In a usual year, there are approximately 250 Ball Boys and Girls from around 1000 applicants who work at Wimbledon.
                 The average age of a Ball person is around 15 years of age, and each person can only work in the tournament for two years. 
                 All of the kids are recruited from local highschools, and about 80 kids are callbacks from the previous year. 
                 Essentially, these kids are trained from Febuary to when the tournament starts if selected. </p>

                <h2>Unspoken Rules </h2>
                <p>There are several unspoken rules when it comes to attending the esteemed tournament. The players are dress coded so they cannot wear anything that isn't white. 
                Oftentimes, the audience is meant to follow the same dresscode. You are not meant to cheer as soon as a player begins their serve. Wimbledon is also not the place to get drunk.
                Not only is it very expenisve, many people will be removed if there is any type of disorderly behavior. Lastly, it is highly frowned upon to have dirty sneakers on, especially in the Centre Courts.</p>
